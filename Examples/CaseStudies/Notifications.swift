    This application demonstrates how to use the `@SharedReader` tool to introduce a piece of \
    read-only state to your feature whose true value lives in an external system. In this case, \
    the state is the number of times a screenshot is taken, which is counted from the \
    `userDidTakeScreenshotNotification` notification, as well as the number of times the app has \
    been backgrounded, which is counted from the `willResignActiveNotification` notification.

    Run this application in the simulator, and take a few screenshots by going to \
    *Device â€º Trigger Screenshot* in the menu, and observe that the UI counts the number of times \
    that happens. And then background the app and re-open the app to see that the UI counts the \
    number of times you do that.
